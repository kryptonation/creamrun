# PVB (Parking Violations Bureau) Module

## Overview

The PVB module manages parking and traffic violations for taxi fleet vehicles. It supports automated CSV imports from NYC Department of Finance, manual entry for violations from other jurisdictions, intelligent driver attribution through CURB trip matching, and seamless integration with the centralized ledger system.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **CSV Import**: Automated import of DOF weekly violation files
- **Manual Entry**: Create violations from mail/email notifications
- **Smart Matching**: Time-window based CURB trip correlation (±30 minutes)
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.00-1.00 confidence scores for auto-matching
- **Ledger Integration**: Automatic posting of violations as PVB obligations
- **Document Management**: Upload and attach summons documents
- **Manual Remapping**: Override automatic assignments with audit trail
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Query violations by date, driver, vehicle, status
- **Export Functionality**: Excel, PDF, CSV export with filters
- **Import History**: Complete audit trail of all imports

### Intelligent Matching

The module uses a sophisticated matching algorithm:

1. **Vehicle Identification**: Match plate number to vehicle
2. **Time Window Search**: Find CURB trips within ±30 minutes of violation
3. **Confidence Calculation**:
   - Base score: 0.50 (plate match)
   - Time proximity: +0.30 (within 10 min) to +0.10 (within 30 min)
   - Location match: +0.10 (county/borough)
   - Driver consistency: +0.10 (previous use of vehicle)
4. **Threshold Application**:
   - ≥0.90: Auto-match
   - 0.50-0.89: Manual review recommended
   - <0.50: Plate-only match

## Celery Tasks

### Scheduled Tasks

**import_weekly_dof_pvb**
- Schedule: Every Saturday at 5:00 AM
- Automatically imports weekly DOF CSV
- Performs matching and posting

**retry_unmapped_pvb**
- Schedule: Daily at 6:00 AM
- Re-attempts matching for unmapped violations
- Uses updated CURB trip data

**post_unposted_pvb**
- Schedule: Daily at 7:00 AM
- Posts mapped but unposted violations
- Ensures ledger stays current

### Manual Tasks

**import_pvb_csv_async**
- Triggered by: API upload endpoint
- For large CSV files requiring async processing

**bulk_remap_pvb**
- Triggered by: Bulk remap operations
- Remaps multiple violations to same driver

## Business Rules

### Matching Algorithm

1. **Vehicle Lookup**: Match plate_number to vehicles table
2. **CURB Trip Search**: Find trips within ±30 minutes
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate 0.00-1.00 score
4. **Threshold Application**: Auto-match if ≥0.90

### Ledger Posting

**Category**: PVB (4th in payment hierarchy)

**Posting Type**: DEBIT (obligation)

**Amount**: amount_due (fine + penalty + interest - reduction - payment)

**Requirements**:
- Must have driver_id and lease_id
- amount_due > 0
- Not in DISPUTED or DISMISSED status
- Not already posted

**Payment Period**: Sunday-Saturday week containing issue_date

### Payment Hierarchy

In the DTR payment waterfall, PVB is priority 4:

1. Taxes (MTA, TIF, Congestion, etc.)
2. EZPass
3. Lease Fees
4. **PVB Violations** ← This module
5. TLC Tickets
6. Repairs
7. Driver Loans
8. Miscellaneous

## Error Handling

### Import Errors

**Duplicate Summons**: Skipped automatically, counted in statistics

**Invalid Data**: Row recorded in pvb_import_failures, import continues

**Mapping Failures**: Violation created with UNKNOWN status, flagged for manual review

**Posting Failures**: Violation created and mapped, retried in scheduled task

### API Errors

- **400**: Invalid CSV format, missing required fields
- **404**: Violation/batch not found
- **409**: Duplicate summons number
- **500**: Database/S3/ledger service errors

## Usage Examples

### Import CSV File

```python

service = PVBImportService(db)

import_history, errors = service.import_csv_file(
    csv_content=csv_string,
    file_name="DOF_Weekly_20251028.csv",
    perform_matching=True,
    post_to_ledger=True,
    auto_match_threshold=Decimal('0.90'),
    triggered_by="API",
    triggered_by_user_id=user.id
)

print(f"Imported: {import_history.total_imported}")
print(f"Matched: {import_history.auto_matched_count}")
print(f"Posted: {import_history.posted_to_ledger_count}")
```

### Create Manual Violation

```python
violation = service.create_manual_violation(
    data={
        'summons_number': '4046361992',
        'plate_number': 'Y205630C',
        'state': 'NY',
        'issue_date': datetime(2025, 7, 3, 7, 52),
        'fine_amount': Decimal('250.00'),
        'amount_due': Decimal('250.00'),
        'notes': 'Received via mail from NJ DOF'
    },
    created_by_user_id=user.id,
    perform_matching=True,
    post_to_ledger=True
)
```

### Remap Violation

```python
violation = service.remap_violation_manually(
    violation_id=12345,
    driver_id=234,
    lease_id=890,
    reason="Driver confirmed they were operating vehicle",
    assigned_by_user_id=user.id,
    notes="Called driver to verify"
)
```

### Query Violations

```python
from app.pvb.repository import PVBViolationRepository

repo = PVBViolationRepository(db)

violations, total = repo.find_violations(
    date_from=datetime(2025, 7, 1),
    date_to=datetime(2025, 7, 31),
    driver_id=234,
    posted_to_ledger=True,
    limit=50,
    offset=0
)
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload DOF CSV file
- [ ] Verify violations imported correctly
- [ ] Check auto-matching accuracy
- [ ] Create manual violation from mail
- [ ] Upload summons document
- [ ] Remap violation manually
- [ ] Verify ledger posting created
- [ ] Check DTR includes PVB balance
- [ ] Export violations to Excel
- [ ] Test all filters and sorting
- [ ] Review unmapped violations
- [ ] Test bulk operations

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Complete flow: CSV → matching → posting → DTR
- [ ] Remap with ledger void/repost
- [ ] Duplicate summons handling
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Scheduled task execution

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- Daily import success rate
- Unmapped violation percentage
- Average matching confidence
- Posting success rate
- Processing time per batch

### Alerts

- Import failures
- High unmapped rate (>10%)
- Posting failures
- Missing scheduled imports
- File size anomalies

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Low Auto-Match Rate

**Cause**: CURB trips not being imported regularly

**Solution**: 
1. Check CURB import schedule
2. Verify CURB API connection
3. Consider lowering threshold temporarily

### Issue: Violations Not Posting

**Cause**: Missing driver_id or lease_id

**Solution**:
1. Check unmapped violations queue
2. Manually assign driver/lease
3. Run post_unposted_pvb task

### Issue: CSV Import Fails

**Cause**: Format mismatch

**Solution**:
1. Verify CSV has all required columns
2. Check for encoding issues
3. Review import failure details

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

**Large CSV Files**:
- Use bulk insert operations (implemented)
- Process in batches
- Consider async task for 1000+ rows

**Query Performance**:
- Indexes on: plate_number, issue_date, driver_id, posting_status
- Use pagination for large result sets
- Filter by date range to reduce dataset

**Matching Performance**:
- CURB trips table indexed on vehicle_id and datetime
- Time window queries optimized
- Consider caching vehicle lookups
