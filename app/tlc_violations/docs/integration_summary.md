- `idx_tlc_status_posting` - Status-based queries
- `idx_tlc_hearing_date` - Hearing tracking
- `idx_tlc_doc_violation` - Document retrieval

### Enumerations

- **ViolationType** (6 categories): Driver Conduct, Vehicle Condition, Licensing, Fare Issues, Operational, Administrative
- **ViolationStatus** (5 states): NEW, HEARING_SCHEDULED, DECISION_RECEIVED, RESOLVED, VOIDED
- **Disposition** (6 outcomes): PENDING, DISMISSED, GUILTY, PAID, REDUCED, SUSPENDED
- **Borough** (5 values): MANHATTAN, BROOKLYN, QUEENS, BRONX, STATEN_ISLAND
- **HearingLocation** (6 locations): 5 OATH locations + REMOTE
- **PostingStatus** (3 states): PENDING, POSTED, FAILED

## Business Rules Enforced

1. **Uniqueness**: Summons numbers must be unique across all violations
2. **Driver Assignment**: Required before posting to ledger
3. **Lease Assignment**: Required before posting to ledger
4. **Posting Restrictions**: Cannot post if voided or already posted
5. **Update Restrictions**: Cannot update if posted or voided (must void and recreate)
6. **Remapping Logic**: Auto-voids and requires reposting if already posted
7. **Voiding Logic**: Creates reversal posting if already posted to ledger
8. **Payment Hierarchy**: TLC category is Priority 5 (after Taxes, EZPass, Lease, PVB)
9. **Document Limits**: 5MB max file size, PDF/JPG/PNG only
10. **CURB Matching**: ±30 minute time window for trip correlation
