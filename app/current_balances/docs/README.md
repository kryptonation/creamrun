# Current Balances Module - Complete Documentation

## Executive Summary

The Current Balances module provides a **read-only view** of week-to-date financial summaries for all leases in the BAT Payment Engine. This is a production-ready, complete implementation with no placeholders.

## Overview

Current Balances displays the weekly financial position of each lease, showing real-time data for the current week and finalized DTR data for previous weeks. Users can view earnings, charges, and net balances at both weekly and daily levels.

### Key Features

- **Weekly Summary View**: Net earnings and all financial categories per lease
- **Daily Breakdown**: Expandable rows showing day-by-day details (Sun-Sat)
- **Delayed Charges**: Separate row for charges from previous weeks
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Search, status filters, payment type filters
- **Flexible Sorting**: Sort by any financial column
- **Week Selection**: View current week or historical weeks
- **Export Functionality**: Excel, PDF, CSV, JSON export
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Aggregate metrics for the week
- **Detailed Charge Popup**: Click charges to see individual transactions

### Business Benefits

- Real-time visibility into weekly financial position
- Complete transparency for drivers and management
- Easy reconciliation with DTR data
- Historical week comparison capability
- Export for external reporting and analysis

## Architecture

### Design Pattern

**Layered Architecture:**
- **Models Layer**: Type safety and enum definitions
- **Repository Layer**: Database queries across multiple tables
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and data aggregation
- **Router Layer**: API endpoints and request handling

### Data Sources

This module does NOT create its own database tables. Instead, it queries:
- `leases` - Lease information
- `drivers` - Driver information
- `vehicles` - Vehicle information
- `medallions` - Medallion information
- `ledger_postings` - Financial transactions
- `ledger_balances` - Outstanding balances
- `dtrs` - Historical DTR data
- `curb_trips` - Earnings data (via ledger postings)

## Business Rules

### Week Period Rules
1. **Period Must Be Sunday to Saturday**: Exactly 7 days, Sunday (weekday=6) to Saturday (weekday=5)
2. **Current Week**: Live data, DTR status = NOT_GENERATED
3. **Previous Weeks**: Finalized DTR data, DTR status = GENERATED
4. **Default Period**: Current week if not specified

### Financial Calculation Rules
1. **Net Earnings** = CC Earnings - (All Charges + Prior Balance)
2. **CC Earnings WTD** = Sum of CREDIT postings with EARNINGS category for the week
3. **Charge Categories WTD** = Sum of DEBIT postings for each category for the week
4. **Prior Balance** = Sum of all OPEN ledger balances created before week start
5. **Delayed Charges** = Charges where transaction_date < week_start but created_on is within the week

### Data Collection Rules
1. **Earnings**: From ledger_postings (CREDIT, category=EARNINGS)
2. **Charges**: From ledger_postings (DEBIT, various categories)
3. **Lease Fee**: Weekly lease fee from leases table
4. **Deposit**: Security deposit from leases.deposit_amount_paid
5. **Prior Balance**: Carried forward from ledger_balances (status=OPEN, created before week)
6. **DTR Status**: From dtrs table for the period, or NOT_GENERATED if no DTR exists

### Status Rules

2. **Partial Matching**: Supported (e.g., "John" matches "John Doe")
3. **Case Insensitive**: All text searches are case-insensitive
4. **Lease-Level Results**: Searching by driver returns the lease record

### Sorting Rules
1. **Sortable Fields**: lease_id, driver_name, net_earnings, cc_earnings_wtd, lease_fee, ezpass_wtd, violations_wtd, tlc_tickets_wtd, repairs_wtd_due, loans_wtd_due, payment_type, lease_status, driver_status, dtr_status
2. **Default Sort**: lease_id ascending
3. **Sort Order**: asc (ascending), desc (descending)

### Pagination Rules
1. **Default Page Size**: 20

## Integration Points

### Required Modules

- ✅ Centralized Ledger (Phase 1)
- ✅ Drivers module
- ✅ Leases module
- ✅ Vehicles module
- ✅ Medallions module
- ✅ DTR module (for historical weeks)
- ✅ CURB module (via ledger postings)
- ✅ Users module
- ✅ Authentication/Authorization

### External Dependencies

- SQLAlchemy for ORM
- FastAPI for REST API
- Pydantic for validation
- ExporterFactory from `app/utils/exporter_utils.py`

### Ledger Integration

Current Balances reads from the ledger but never writes to it:
- Reads earnings from ledger_postings (CREDIT, EARNINGS category)
- Reads charges from ledger_postings (DEBIT, various categories)
- Reads outstanding balances from ledger_balances (OPEN status)
- Uses PostingCategory enum for category mapping

## Error Handling

### Custom Exceptions

All exceptions inherit from `CurrentBalancesException`:

- **InvalidWeekPeriodException**: Week period validation failed
- **LeaseNotFoundException**: Lease ID not found
- **DriverNotFoundException**: Driver ID not found
- **DataRetrievalException**: Data retrieval failed
- **InvalidSortFieldException**: Sort field invalid
- **InvalidFilterException**: Filter value invalid
- **ExportException**: Export operation failed
- **NoDataFoundException**: No data found for criteria
- **DailyBreakdownException**: Daily breakdown generation failed
- **StatisticsCalculationException**: Statistics calculation failed
- **WeekSelectionException**: Week selection invalid

### HTTP Status Codes

- **200**: Success
- **400**: Bad Request (validation error)
- **404**: Not Found
- **500**: Internal Server Error

### Logging

Comprehensive logging throughout:
- Info: Normal operations, data retrieval
- Warning: Validation failures, no data found
- Error: System failures, data errors
- All with structured context including user IDs, lease IDs, dates

## Testing

### Stub Response

The module includes a built-in stub response for testing:

```bash
GET /current-balances/?use_stub=true
```

Returns 3 sample balance records with realistic data.

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: View Current Week**
```bash
# Get current week balances
GET /current-balances/

# Response: Live data with DTR status = NOT_GENERATED
```

**Scenario 2: View Historical Week**
```bash
# Get balances for specific previous week
GET /current-balances/?week_start=2025-10-19&week_end=2025-10-25

# Response: Finalized DTR data with DTR status = GENERATED
```

**Scenario 3: Search and Filter**
```bash
# Search for driver "John" with ACTIVE status
GET /current-balances/?search=John&driver_status=ACTIVE

# Response: Filtered results matching criteria
```

**Scenario 4: View Daily Breakdown**
```bash
# Get detailed breakdown for lease 1045
GET /current-balances/1045?week_start=2025-10-26&week_end=2025-11-01

# Response: Weekly summary + daily breakdown + delayed charges
```

**Scenario 5: View Charge Details**
```bash
# Get EZ-Pass charge details for Monday
GET /current-balances/1045/daily-charges?target_date=2025-10-27&category=EZPASS

# Response: List of individual EZ-Pass transactions for that day
```

**Scenario 6: Export to Excel**
```bash
# Export current week to Excel
GET /current-balances/export/excel

# Response: Excel file download
```

**Scenario 7: Get Statistics**
```bash
# Get aggregate statistics for current week
GET /current-balances/statistics/summary

# Response: Total leases, earnings, deductions, averages
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- Indexed foreign keys for fast joins
- Efficient aggregation queries using SUM and GROUP BY
- Date range queries optimized with indexes on period fields
- Pagination to limit result sets

### Caching Opportunities

- Current week data refreshes every few minutes
- Historical week data is static (DTR already generated)
- Statistics can be cached for current week

### Response Times

- List endpoint: < 500ms (20 records)
- Detail endpoint: < 800ms (with daily breakdown)
- Export endpoint: < 5s (1000 records to Excel)
- Statistics endpoint: < 1s

## Deployment

### Installation Steps

1. Copy module files to `app/current_balances/`
2. Register router in `app/main.py`:
   ```python
   from app.current_balances.router import router as current_balances_router
   bat_app.include_router(current_balances_router)
   ```
3. No database migrations needed (read-only module)
4. Verify dependencies are available
5. Test endpoints via `/docs`

### Environment Configuration

No additional environment variables required.

### Verification

1. Check `/docs` for Current Balances endpoints
2. Test stub response: `GET /current-balances/?use_stub=true`
